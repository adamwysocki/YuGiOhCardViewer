# YuGiOhCardViewer

My first react-native app. A viewer for Yu-Gi-Oh cards that I wrote for my boys. WIP for sure.

Goals here were pretty basic:
 - Learn the basics of react-native
 - Write a cross platform native mobile app with a single code base
 - Consume an API or two
 - Publish the app to the iTunes store and Google Play store

Stuff to do:
 - More components - I can keep digging here
 - Analytics - would like to better track if it's being used and how
 - Write a blog post about my pain points to share with others
 - Figure out automated tests
